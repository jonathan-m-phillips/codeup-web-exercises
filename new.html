<p><a href="https://html.com/">HTML</a> stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to the user.</p>

<p>In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in an &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
<p>And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>
